## Skills API

When **Settings → Register skills as Ctrl+P commands** is enabled, each skill file is registered as an Obsidian command at plugin load (and on every "Reload skills" call). This turns your skills folder into a lightweight automation API for your vault.

### Command ID format

Skill commands follow the pattern:

```
obsidibot:skill-<slugified-filename>
```

Where the slug is the filename (minus `.md`) lowercased with non-alphanumeric characters replaced by hyphens. For example:

| File | Command ID |
|---|---|
| `Weekly Review.md` | `obsidibot:skill-weekly-review` |
| `Bug Report.md` | `obsidibot:skill-bug-report` |
| `summarize-note.md` | `obsidibot:skill-summarize-note` |

### Assigning hotkeys

Any skill can be given a keyboard shortcut via **Settings → Hotkeys**. Search for `Skill:` to find all registered skills. This means you can bind your most-used agentic workflows to a single keypress.

### Using skills from other plugins

Because skills are standard Obsidian commands, any plugin that can trigger commands can trigger skills — including Templater, QuickAdd, Commander, and others. Reference the command ID directly:

```
obsidibot:skill-weekly-review
```

This makes ObsidiBot skills composable with the rest of your Obsidian automation stack.

### Behaviour when the panel is closed

If the ObsidiBot chat panel is not open when a skill command runs, the panel opens automatically before the skill executes. For parameterized skills, the form modal appears on top of the newly opened panel.
