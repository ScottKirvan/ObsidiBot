# Skills

A **skill** is a markdown file that gives Claude a defined mission. Skills live in your skills folder and appear in the `/` menu — and optionally in the Obsidian command palette — ready to run on demand.

Skills range from simple reusable prompts to fully parameterized agentic workflows. Because Claude runs with full tool access, a skill can read and write vault notes, run shell commands, call APIs, and more. If you can describe it in a prompt, you can make it a skill.

## File format

A skill file is a standard markdown file with optional YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
category: Reviews
description: Structured weekly review
autorun: true
params:
  - id: focus
    type: input
    label: Any specific focus area?
    placeholder: Leave blank for a full review
---
Review my notes from this week. Give me:
- What I worked on
- Open threads or unresolved questions
- Suggested priorities for next week

{{focus}}
```

The frontmatter controls how the skill appears in the menu and how it behaves. The body is the prompt Claude receives.

## Frontmatter reference

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `category` | string | `Prompts` | Groups the skill under a named heading in the `/` menu |
| `description` | string | *(none)* | Short subtitle shown below the skill name |
| `autorun` | boolean | `false` | If `true`, executes immediately. If `false`, inserts into the chat input for review |
| `params` | array | *(none)* | Form fields presented to the user before the skill runs |

## `params` fields

When `params` is defined, ObsidiBot shows a modal form before running the skill. Each entry is an object with the following properties:

| Property | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | Yes | Variable name used in `{{interpolation}}` in the prompt body |
| `type` | Yes | Field type — see below |
| `label` | Yes | Human-readable label shown in the form |
| `description` | No | Helper text shown below the label |
| `placeholder` | No | Placeholder text for `input` and `textarea` fields |
| `options` | Yes (dropdown, checkboxes) | Array of string values |
| `default` | No | Pre-filled value |
| `validations.required` | No | If `true`, blocks submission when the field is empty |

### Field types

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| `input` | Single-line text field |
| `textarea` | Multi-line text field |
| `dropdown` | Select from a fixed list of options |
| `checkboxes` | One or more boolean toggles — result is a comma-separated string |
| `note` | Vault note picker — fuzzy search over all vault notes; injects the **full note content** as an attachment (same as @-mention) |

### Variable interpolation

Use `{{id}}` in the prompt body to reference field values. After submission:

- **Non-note fields** are interpolated inline.
- **Note fields** are added as context attachments (shown as badges above the input, just like @-mention). The `{{id}}` token is stripped from the body — the note content arrives via the attachment, not inline text.
- Unresolved tokens (optional fields left blank) are stripped cleanly. No visible `{{placeholder}}` tokens appear in the output.

## Execution modes

| `autorun` | `params` | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `false` | none | Inserts prompt body into chat input for review |
| `true` | none | Fires immediately; shows `Running: <name>` in chat |
| `false` | defined | Shows form → inserts filled prompt into chat input |
| `true` | defined | Shows form → fires immediately on submit |

## Skills folder

**Default:** `<plugin dir>/commands/` — inside the plugin directory and gitignored by default.

**Custom:** set **Settings → ObsidiBot → Skills folder** to:
- A vault-relative path (e.g. `_skills`) — keeps skills in your vault, synced with Obsidian Git
- An absolute path — for a shared folder outside the vault

Skills reload each time you open the `/` menu, so changes take effect immediately with no restart.

## Examples

### Simple autorun

```markdown
---
category: Writing
description: Summarize the active note
autorun: true
---
Summarize the currently active note concisely, preserving key decisions and open questions.
```

### Weekly review with optional focus

```markdown
---
category: Reviews
description: Structured weekly review
autorun: true
params:
  - id: focus
    type: input
    label: Focus area (optional)
    placeholder: Leave blank for a full review
---
Review my notes from this week and give me:
- What I worked on
- Open threads or unresolved questions
- Suggested priorities for next week

{{focus}}
```

### Bug report with form

```markdown
---
category: GitHub
description: File a bug report on any repo
autorun: true
params:
  - id: repo
    type: input
    label: Repository
    placeholder: owner/repo
    validations:
      required: true
  - id: title
    type: input
    label: Bug title
    validations:
      required: true
  - id: severity
    type: dropdown
    label: Severity
    options: [low, medium, high, critical]
    default: medium
  - id: body
    type: textarea
    label: Description
    placeholder: Steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior…
---
File a GitHub issue in {{repo}}.

Title: {{title}}
Severity: {{severity}}

{{body}}
```

### Note summarizer using vault picker

```markdown
---
category: Writing
description: Summarize any vault note
autorun: true
params:
  - id: target_note
    type: note
    label: Note to summarize
    validations:
      required: true
---
Summarize the attached note concisely, preserving key decisions and open questions.
```

The picked note is injected as a context attachment — Claude reads it exactly as it would read an @-mentioned note.

### Programming agent

```markdown
---
category: Code
description: Implement a feature in this repo
autorun: true
params:
  - id: feature
    type: textarea
    label: What should I build?
    placeholder: Describe the feature in plain language…
    validations:
      required: true
  - id: context_note
    type: note
    label: Relevant design note (optional)
---
You are acting as a senior software engineer working in this vault's codebase.

Task: {{feature}}

Read the relevant files, understand the existing architecture, implement the feature, and write a brief summary of what you changed and why.
```

## Ctrl+P integration

Enable **Settings → Register skills as Ctrl+P commands** to expose every skill as an Obsidian command palette entry, prefixed `Skill: …`.

After adding or removing skill files, run **ObsidiBot: Reload skills** from the palette to sync. You can also assign hotkeys to individual skills via **Settings → Hotkeys** — search for `Skill:` to find them all.

See the [Skills API](./commands#skills-api) section of the Commands reference for details.
