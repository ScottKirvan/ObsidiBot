| **Permission mode**                | Standard                                             | Controls what vault operations Claude can perform. See [Permissions](./permissions).                                                                                 |
| **Command Allowlist**              | `switcher:open`, `daily-notes`, `editor:open-search` | Obsidian commands Claude can run via the UI Bridge. Found under **UI Bridge & Commands**. Allowlisted commands execute immediately.                                  |

| **Denied commands**                | *(hidden until used)*                                | Shows count of permanently denied commands with a **Clear denylist** button. To re-enable a specific command, add it to the allowlist via the command browser.       |
| **Enable debug log**               | On                                                   | Write a debug log file. See [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting#logging).                                                                                            |
| **Log file path**                  | `.obsidian/plugins/obsidibot/obsidibot-debug.log`    | Vault-relative path for the log file. Defaults to the plugin folder so it stays out of your vault and git history.                                                   |
| **Log verbosity**                  | Normal                                               | **Normal** logs session events and errors. **Verbose** adds raw stream data and token breakdowns.                                                                    |
| **@-mention file types**           | `md, fountain, txt`                                  | Comma-separated file extensions included in the `@` autocomplete dropdown.                                                                                           |
| **Inject split-pane files**        | On                                                   | When in split-pane view, include all visible file paths as active note context.                                                                                      |

## Session storage location

By default, session files are stored in `.obsidian/obsidibot/sessions/` inside your vault. This folder is typically gitignored, so sessions don't appear in your git history.

You can change this in **Settings → ObsidiBot → Session storage path**:

| Value | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| *(empty)* | Default — `.obsidian/obsidibot/sessions/`. Gitignored. |
| `_sessions` (vault-relative) | Sessions stored at `_sessions/` in your vault root. Tracked by git if not excluded. |
| `/Users/you/sessions` (absolute) | Sessions stored outside the vault entirely. |

::: warning Sessions are not migrated
Changing this setting affects **new sessions only**. Existing sessions remain in their original location and will not appear in the session manager until you change the path back. If you want to move existing sessions, copy the `.json` files manually to the new path before restarting ObsidiBot.
